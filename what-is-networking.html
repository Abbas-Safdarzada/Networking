      <h2>What is a Network?</h2>
      <p>A network is a collection of interconnected devices or nodes that can communicate with each other and share information, resources, or services. Networks can be physical (e.g., wires, cables) or wireless (e.g., radio waves, infrared) and can vary in size and complexity.</p>

    <div class="topology">
      <h2>What is a Network Topology?</h2>
      <p>A network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and the connections between them in a network. It describes how the nodes are organized and how they communicate with each other. There are various types of network topologies, including bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples">
      <h2>Examples of networks and topologies.</h2>
      <p>Examples of networks include the internet, local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), wireless networks, and cellular networks. Examples of network topologies include bus topology, where all nodes are connected to a single backbone; star topology, where all nodes are connected to a central hub; ring topology, where nodes are connected in a closed loop; mesh topology, where all nodes are connected to each other; and hybrid topology, which combines multiple topologies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="importance">
      <h2>Why networks and network topologies are important.</h2>
      <p>Networks and network topologies are important because they allow devices to communicate and share information efficiently, support remote work and global communication, and enable the growth of businesses and industries. Proper network design and topology selection can ensure reliable and secure communication, minimize downtime and data loss, and support the scalability and flexibility of a network.</p>
